# Advent of Code 2021

This repo contains code I generated for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

I used the Advent of Code to practice and enhance my Python skills, from basic logic to custom modules, Object-Oriented 
Programming, and unit tests. So far, I have achieved 43 out of 50 :star: (two possible per day); days 1-20 are complete.

Highlights:
* Day 4: Bingo
* Day 5: 2D mapping part 1 - plotting lines
* Day 8: Signal decoder
* Day 9: 2D mapping part 2 - interpreting heightmaps
* Day 10: Syntax checker
* Day 15: 2D mapping part 3 - Dijkstra's shortest path
* Day 19: 3D mapping
